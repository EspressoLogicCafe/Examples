# ReadPropertiesFile

In this Example we demonstrate how you can read a .property file within Live API Creator.

To use this example follow the below steps:
- Pull the project.
- Create a zip of the ReadPropertiesFile folder.
- Import the zip file into API Creator.
- From the API Properties, click the Libraries tab. The "readprop" file has the core code to read the properties file.
- From the Manage section, click Listeners, click the Code tab. The listener code demonstrates how to load a properties file within an API.
